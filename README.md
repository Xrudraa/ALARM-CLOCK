This code is an HTML document with embedded JavaScript that creates an alarm clock web application. The web application allows users to set alarms by selecting hours, minutes, and seconds. The alarms are then displayed in a list below the alarm clock.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type to be HTML.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
The <head> element contains meta-information about the document.
The <title> element specifies a title for the document.
The <body> element contains the visible page content.
The <div> elements are used for styling and layout purposes.
The <h1> element defines a large heading.
The <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
The <select> element is used to create a dropdown list.
The <button> element defines a clickable button.
The <script> element is used to embed JavaScript code in an HTML document.
The JavaScript code in the script.js file handles the functionality of the alarm clock. It includes functions for updating the current time, setting alarms, and displaying the alarms in the list.

Here is an example of how the code works:

The user selects the desired time for the alarm (e.g., 7:30 AM).
The user clicks the "Set Alarm" button.
The JavaScript code adds the selected time to the list of alarms.
The alarm clock will display the list of alarms set by the user.
The code also includes a stylesheet (styles.css) for styling the web application.

Overall, this code creates a functional and visually appealing alarm clock web application. Users can easily set alarms and view the list of alarms they have set.


This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that styles a simple alarm clock web application. It includes global styles, such as the font family and body margin, as well as specific styles for various elements within the application.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Global Styles: These styles apply to the entire application. They include setting the font family to sans-serif, and defining a basic button style.

Flexbox Container: The .d-flex class is used to create a flexbox container. This container is used to align and distribute elements within the application.

Alarm Clock Container: The .clock-container class styles the main container of the alarm clock application. It sets the background color, padding, and alignment of elements within the container.

Current Time Display: The .current-time class styles the current time display. It sets the font size to 2rem and the color to black.

Alarm Form: The .alarm-form class styles the form used to set alarms. It sets the flex flow direction to column and aligns the elements to the start of the container.

Submit Button: The .submit-button class styles the submit button used to set alarms. It sets the border color to black, adds a border radius, and sets the font weight to bold.

Set Alarm Container: The .set-alarm-container class styles the container that holds the set alarms. It sets the width to 100% and aligns the elements to the center.

Set Alarm Container Title: The .set-alarm-container-title class styles the title of the set alarm container. It sets the color to black, the font weight to bold, and the font size to 1rem.

Alarm: The .alarm class styles each individual alarm. It sets the justify content to space between, adds padding, and aligns the elements to the center.

Delete Alarm Button: The .delete-alarm class styles the delete alarm button. It sets the border radius, background color, font weight, and font color.

Time Display: The .time class styles the time display of each alarm. It sets the color to #0E141B, the font size to 1rem, and the font weight to bold.

Button Hover and Focus: The .btn:focus and .btn:hover classes style the button when it is focused or hovered over. They add a box shadow to give the button a subtle hover effect.

Page Title: The .page-title class styles the page title. It sets the background color to #0E141B, aligns the text to the center, and sets the color to wheat.

Media Query: This media query applies styles to the application when the screen width is 600px or greater. It adds padding to the main container and sets the width and min-height of the clock container.

Overall, this CSS file provides the styling for a simple alarm clock web application.


Sure! This code is written in JavaScript and it appears to be a simple web application that allows a user to set an alarm for a specific time. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Selecting HTML elements: The code starts by selecting various HTML elements using their id attributes. These elements include the current time display, dropdown menus for hours, minutes, and seconds, the AM/PM indicator, the set alarm button, and the container for displaying set alarms.

Creating dropdown menus: The dropDownMenu function is used to create and populate dropdown menus for hours, minutes, and seconds. It takes in a start and end value, and creates an option element for each value between the start and end.

Getting the current time: The getCurrentTime function gets the current time and updates the HTML element that displays the current time. It uses the Date object to get the current time, and formats it using the toLocaleTimeString method.

Setting an alarm: The getInput function is called when the set alarm button is clicked. It gets the values of the hours, minutes, and seconds dropdown menus, as well as the AM/PM indicator, and converts them to a 24-hour time format using the convertToTime function. It then sets an alarm for the specified time using the setAlarm function.

Setting alarms: The setAlarm function sets an alarm for the specified time. It uses the setInterval method to check if the current time matches the alarm time every 500 milliseconds. If the current time matches the alarm time, it displays an alert message. It also adds the alarm to the HTML element that displays all set alarms using the addAlaramToDom function.

Displaying alarms: The addAlaramToDom function creates a new HTML element for the alarm and adds it to the HTML element that displays all set alarms. It also adds a delete button to each alarm that allows the user to delete the alarm.

Saving alarms: The saveAlarm function saves the set alarms to the browser's localStorage so that they persist even if the page is refreshed.

Fetching alarms: The fetchAlarm function fetches the set alarms from the localStorage and sets alarms for each one using the setAlarm function.

Deleting alarms: The deleteAlarm function is called when the delete button for an alarm is clicked. It removes the alarm from the HTML element that displays all set alarms and from the localStorage.

Overall, this code is a simple but well-written web application that allows a user to set alarms for specific times. It uses the browser's localStorage to persist the set alarms even if the page is refreshed.
